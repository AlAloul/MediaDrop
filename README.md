# MediaDrop
A simple example HTML + JS file which provides an interface to drag and drop a single **image, audio or video** file onto the browser and read the relevant information from it (filesize, dimensions, duration) and provide the data for uploading somewhere (eg: via XHR). Also provides audio waveform and video thumbnail capability for those file types. 

***No JavaScript dependencies.***

Supports : (most) `jpg`, `gif`, `png`, `mp3`, `wav`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `mp4`, `m4v` and `avi` files.

#### [DEMO](https://kosso.github.io/demos/media_drop/media_drop.html)

- Image files do nothing but ready the file info for whatever you need.
- Audio files will automatically create an audio waveform PNG file. 
- Video files allow the user to to choose a frame and create a thumbnail image.
